# ‚öΩ Soccer time converter

Soccer timer converter is a service that helps you on soccer match time conversion.

The application is available on https://soccer-time-converter.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html

## üßë‚Äçüíª Environment

To set up a development environment for this application you may need to set up the [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

You also need the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/). You can also use the Gradle wrapper configured on this project.

## üöÄ Running the application

I developed this application using Gradle build tool and the Spring Boot framework. To run the application you need to:

1. On command line (or on your favorite Java IDE) run `bootRun` gradle task.

    ```
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

1. The application will be available on `http://localhost:8080`

    - You can access http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to see the swagger interface to the service

1. To convert a value, you need to execute a `GET` request to http://localhost:8080/converter passing a input on `matchTime` query parameter.

```
Input: [H1] 45:00.001
URL: http://localhost:8080/converter?matchTime=%5BH1%5D%203%3A07.513
```

**_Note: the input must be url encoded_**

**_Note 2: you don't need to worry about the input encoding if you are using swagger-ui to make the request._**

## üß™ Running unit tests

To run the tests you need to run the `test` gradle task.

```
./gradlew test
```

After the test, testing reports are generated. You can check this on `/build/reports/jacoco/test/html` folder.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the application

To build the application you just need to run the `build` task.

```
./gradlew build
```

## üòé Other interesting stuff

-   The [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to verify the code style.
-   The [JaCoCo test coverage verification](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html) is configured to ensure that at least 80% of the lines and branches are covered by tests.
-   I configured [Netris commit lint plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ru.netris.commitlint) to lint the commit messages to meet the [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
-   [Gradle Git Hook](https://github.com/STAR-ZERO/gradle-githook) is being used to integrate the code style and commit message verification on git hooks.
-   The pull request or push in master branch will trigger a pipeline automation that build the application (run tests and check style) and deploy it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home)
